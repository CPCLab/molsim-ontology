# molsim: Molecular Simulation Ontology

## Introduction

molsim is an interoperable domain ontology designed to semantically represent platform-agnostic molecular simulations as FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) datasets. This ontology aims to standardize the representation of molecular simulation data, processes, and methodologies across different platforms and tools.

## Scope

The ontology covers various aspects of molecular simulations, including:

- Simulation processes (preparation, execution, analysis)
- Force fields and models
- Algorithms (thermostats, barostats, constraining algorithms)
- Materials and solvation models
- Interaction types and calculation methods

## Opening the Ontology

You can open and explore molsim using Protégé, a free, open-source ontology editor. Protégé is available in both desktop and web versions.

### Desktop Version

1. Download and install Protégé desktop from: https://protege.stanford.edu/
2. Launch Protégé
3. Go to File > Open
4. Navigate to the location of the `molsim.ttl` file and open it

### Web Version

1. Visit WebProtégé: https://webprotege.stanford.edu/
2. Create an account or log in
3. Click on "Create Project" or "Upload Project"
4. Upload the `molsim.ttl` file

Note: WebProtégé does not support reasoner. Please use the desktop version instead to ensure proper logical checks.
