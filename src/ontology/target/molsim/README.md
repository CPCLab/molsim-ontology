Description: Molsim is an interoperable domain ontology designed to semantically represent platform-agnostic molecular simulations as FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) datasets. This ontology aims to standardize the representation of molecular simulation data, processes, and methodologies across different platforms and tools.
