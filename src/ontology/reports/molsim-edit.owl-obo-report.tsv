INFO	lowercase_definition	ff14SB	definition	ff14SB is a protein force-field type, compatible with TIP3P water model.@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	π-π interactions	definition	π–π interaction is a particular type of dispersion force from van der Waals forces, which is established between unsaturated (poly)cyclic molecules.@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	memembed	definition	memembed is a software to determine the membrane proteins orientation inside cell membranes/lipid bilayers.@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	tleap	definition	tleap is used to prepare molecular systems for simulation, including generating topology and coordinate files needed to run molecular dynamics. Tleap loads molecular structures (e.g., from PDB files), applies force field parameters, adds solvent and ions, sets up periodic boundary conditions, and generates AMBER topology (.prmtop) and coordinate (.inpcrd) files, all of which are essential steps in preparing molecular systems for simulation.@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	p-value	definition	p-value represents the likelihood of obtaining your observed results if the null hypothesis (the assumption that there's no real effect or difference) were true.@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	binding free energy	definition	ΔG(binding) is the binding free energy, calculated by: ΔG(binding) = G(complex) - [G(receptor) + G(ligand)].@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	solvation-free energy of ligand	definition	ΔG(solvated) is the solvation free energy associated with the ligand. It represents the free energy change when the ligand is transferred from vacuum to solvent (typically water). This term accounts for the interactions between the ligand and the solvent molecules.@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	electrostatic energy change	definition	ΔE(ele) is the change in electrostatic energy.@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	pyMBAR	definition	pyMBAR is a Python implementation of the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) method. MBAR is a statistical technique used to estimate free energies and expectation values from multiple equilibrium states in molecular simulations. pyMBAR provides a set of tools to perform these calculations on simulation data.@en
