INFO	lowercase_definition	pyMBAR	definition	pyMBAR refers to a specific Python software library implementation of the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) method. MBAR itself is a statistical technique for optimally combining data from multiple simulations to calculate free energies and expectation values. Therefore, pyMBAR is a tool used for the analysis stage of free energy calculations, particularly for processing data generated by methods like umbrella sampling or replica exchange simulations.

INFO	lowercase_definition	ndfes	definition	ndfes is a software package designed for the calculation and analysis of N-dimensional free energy surfaces from molecular simulation data. It includes a collection of scripts for analyzing enhanced sampling simulations, such as those using umbrella sampling or metadynamics. This toolkit allows researchers to reconstruct and visualize complex free energy landscapes defined by multiple collective variables. (UNVERIFIED)@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	parmcal	definition	an interactive utility included in the AmberTools software package for deriving force field parameters. It assists users in calculating new parameters for bond lengths and angles based on a set of built-in empirical rules. This tool is particularly useful when parameterizing a new molecule for which no existing force field parameters are available. (UNVERIFIED)@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	paramfit	definition	paramfit is a tool in the AmberTools suite used to derive or refine the dihedral angle parameters in a force field. It works by fitting the parameters of the torsional energy function to a target potential energy profile, which is typically calculated using high-level quantum mechanics. This tool is crucial for accurately modeling the rotational energy barriers and conformational preferences of new molecules or for improving existing force fields. (UNVERIFIED)@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	placeAV.py	definition	placeAV.py is a utility script used to convert the predicted solvent binding sites from a Placevent analysis into explicit atomic coordinates. It reads the centers of high-density solvent regions determined by the analysis and places dummy atoms or water molecules at those specific locations within a structure file. This tool allows researchers to visualize potential hydration sites or use them as defined starting positions for explicit solvent molecules in subsequent simulations. (UNVERIFIED)@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	match_atomname	definition	match_atomname is a utility program within the AmberTools suite used as a quality control step in simulation setup. It functions by comparing two molecular structure files to ensure that their atom names and connectivity are identical. This check is crucial for preventing errors when processing large sets of conformations where atom ordering might have been inadvertently changed. (UNVERIFIED)@en
INFO	lowercase_definition	ptraj	definition	ptraj was the original command-line program used in the AMBER software suite for analyzing simulation trajectories. It allowed users to process coordinate files to calculate a wide range of properties, such as RMSD, distances, and angles, by reading a script of analysis commands. Although it has now been superseded by its more powerful and flexible successor, cpptraj, ptraj established the fundamental workflow for trajectory analysis in the AMBER community. (UNVERIFIED)@en
