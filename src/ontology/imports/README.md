Ontology download sources:

DC: https://www.dublincore.org/schemas/rdfs/ (OWL file was generated from TTL file there, with "owl:equivalentProperty <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/maker>" removed to allow conversion to OWL format via ROBOT command)
BFO: https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020 (this also includes properties, as some version only provides classes)

The rest were downloadable from Bioportal/OLS.
