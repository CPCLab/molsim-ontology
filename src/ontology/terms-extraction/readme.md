### AmberMD Term Extraction Artifacts

This directory contains artifacts from an automated term extraction process performed on the AmberMD manual. The extracted terms are intended for review before potential addition to the MOLSIM ontology.

### Directory Contents:

* **Python Helper Scripts**: Scripts to process and refine the term lists.
* **CSV Files**: Both the initial source files and the files generated by the scripts.
* **Excel Files**: Merged and formatted results for manual review.

---

## Python Helper Scripts

These scripts help verify, sort, and clean the extracted term data.

* `term_verifier.py`
  
  * **Purpose**: Verifies the occurrence of terms from a CSV file within a plain-text document.
  * **Output**: A new CSV file (`*_occurrence.csv`) containing each term, its frequency, and the line numbers where it appears.

* `verify_in_pdf.py`
  
  * **Purpose**: Verifies the occurrence of terms from a CSV file within a PDF document.
  * **Output**: Similar to the script above, but reports the page number of each occurrence instead of the line number.

* `reorder_duplicates.py`
  
  * **Purpose**: Sorts the output from the verification scripts to group duplicate terms into adjacent rows.
  * **Output**: A reordered CSV file (`*_occurrence_reordered.csv`).

* `deduplicate_terms.py`
  
  * **Purpose**: Analyzes a CSV file to remove duplicate term entries. **Warning: this deduplication script is rather aggressive, hence manual review over deleted rows was also done and then provided in the `print` worksheet in the `*_occurrence_merged.xlsx` files.**
  * **Outputs**:
    1. A deduplicated list of terms (`*_deduplicated.csv`).
    2. The rows that were deemed duplicates and removed (`*_redundant-removed.csv`).

## Recommended Workflow

The scripts are designed to be run in the following sequence:

1. **Verify Terms**: Run `term_verifier.py` or `verify_in_pdf.py` on a source CSV file.
2. **Reorder Duplicates**: Run `reorder_duplicates.py` on the `*_occurrence.csv` file.
3. **Deduplicate**: Run `deduplicate_terms.py` on the `*_occurrence_reordered.csv` file to get the final, clean list.

## File Descriptions

### Source CSV Files

These are the initial, raw lists of terms extracted from various sources.

* `amber-10k.csv`
* `cpptraj-10k.csv`
* `gromacs-50p.csv`

### Generated CSV Files

These files are the outputs of the script workflow and subsequent manual processing.

* `*_occurrence.csv`: Contains terms and their locations (line or page number).
* `*_occurrence_reordered.csv`: The occurrence file sorted to group duplicates.
* `*_deduplicated.csv`: The final, clean list of unique terms.
* `*_redundant-removed.csv`: A log of the duplicate terms that were removed.

### Excel Files

- See **Python Helper Scripts** --> `deduplicate_terms.py` above.
